- [x] Verify entering KINGKONG grants access to the site

## Auth Simplification
- [x] Remove OAuth login button/option from AuthGate — access code only entry
- [x] ~~Remove access code/login requirement on the Advanced tab~~ (reverted — user wants gate to stay)
- [x] Update tests to reflect the changes

## Auth Correction

- [x] Verify: OAuth-signed-in users still see the access code gate before entering the site

## Advanced Tab Access Code Gate Bug
- [x] Fix Advanced tab AccessGate — not requiring access code entry, letting users straight through

## Tasks Tab Access Code Gate

## Flash System — Full Build (Orchestrator, Sessions, UI)
- [x] Create shared/pcanFlashOrchestrator.ts (flash plan generation, simulator engine, recovery plans, NRC descriptions, fun facts)
- [x] Create shared/flashFileValidator.ts (CRC32 big-endian, format detection, file validation, pre-flight checklist, battery voltage evaluation)
- [x] Create DB schema for flash sessions, session logs, ECU snapshots, flash queue, flash stats, file fingerprints, rollback files
- [x] Run drizzle migration for flash tables
- [x] Create server/flashDb.ts with all database helpers (CRUD for sessions, logs, snapshots, queue, stats, comparison, export)
- [x] Expand server/routers/flash.ts with 20+ endpoints (createSession, updateSession, appendLogs, getSessionLogs, exportSession, saveSnapshot, getSnapshots, compareSnapshots, addToQueue, getQueue, updateQueueItem, stats, allStats, compareSessions, checkDuplicate, preFlightChecklist, notifyFlashComplete, completeSession)

- [x] Add "Quick Rundown" toggle to HealthReport for simplified breakdown
- [x] Add "Quick Rundown" toggle to DiagnosticReport for simplified breakdown
- [x] Add fun upgrade prompt in public Analyzer ("YOU'RE RUNNING ON STOCK BOOST") to nudge users toward V-OP Pro

## Bug Fix — PCAN Flash Detection
- [x] Fix PCAN detection in flash system — use same PCANConnection.isBridgeAvailable() as datalogger/bridge

## Bug Fix — PCAN Flash Error After Plan Generation
- [x] Fix error in PCAN flash section after flash plan shows "1 blocks, 1.4 MB" — investigate launch flow and MissionControl integration

## Bug Fix — Flash Plan Validation Errors Block Launch
- [x] Fix generateFlashPlan producing validationErrors for valid containers (shows "1 blocks, 1.4 MB" with red X, disables Launch button)
- [x] Changed seed/key check from blocking error to warning (seed/key embedded in container, extracted at flash time)
- [x] Changed unknown ECU check from blocking error to warning (can still flash with default CAN addresses)
- [x] Added warnings[] field to FlashPlan interface for non-blocking issues
- [x] Updated FlashContainerPanel PCAN section with 3-state status (ok/warn/fail) instead of binary ok/fail
- [x] Updated FlashMissionControl ValidationPanel to display warnings in amber
- [x] Added 3 new tests + enhanced 1 existing test for warning behavior (57 flash tests total)

## Bug Fix — file_fingerprints Table Schema Mismatch
- [x] Fix "Failed query" error on file_fingerprints table — table existed with old schema (column `hash` instead of `fileHash`, etc.)
- [x] Dropped and recreated all 6 flash tables (flash_sessions, flash_session_logs, ecu_snapshots, flash_queue, flash_stats, file_fingerprints) with correct Drizzle schema — all were empty (0 rows)
- [x] Verified all 57 flash integration tests pass after table recreation

## Bug Fix — Flash Simulator Too Fast + Completion Screen Disappears
- [x] Flash simulator completes unrealistically fast — reduced transfer rate from 4000 bytes/tick to 4 bytes/ms (~4 KB/s realistic CAN bus UDS speed)
- [x] Completion screen disappears without showing log report — removed auto-dismiss setTimeout, added DONE + DOWNLOAD LOG buttons, auto-expand log on completion
- [x] Seed/key exchange appeared to work but download phase was instant — added realistic per-phase delays (1.5s-8s per command type)
- [x] Added CAN TX/RX log entries during block transfers for realism (every ~5% of block)
- [x] Fix E41 ECU name — now displays as "E41 (L5P Duramax)" instead of "Bosch MG1CS111 (L5P Duramax)"
- [x] Verify ECU names against strategy docs / A2L references — all GM-Delco ECUs use PPEI strategy names (E41, E88, E90, etc.), Bosch/Ford/Cummins use part numbers
- [x] Updated estimated time calculation to match realistic timing
- [x] Log area expands to h-72 on completion and shows ALL entries (not just last 100)

## Bug Fix — Flash Simulator Progress, Countdown, Section Names, Cal Blocks
- [x] Progress bar stuck at 50% — fixed to time-weighted progress (block transfers weighted by bytes, commands by phase delay)
- [x] Add countdown timer showing estimated time remaining until flash complete (estimatedRemainingMs field)
- [x] Show human-readable section names during flash ("Operating System + Calibration", "Engine Calibration", etc.) via getBlockSectionName()
- [x] Only OS block was flashed — fixed cal block filtering: if ALL blocks are OS (single-block containers like L5P), flash them all
- [x] Add key cycle routines to post-flash sequence (ECU reset, key off 10s, key on, boot wait 5s, verify, read cal ID)
- [x] Add beforeunload warning to prevent accidental tab close during active flash
- [x] Add Wake Lock API to prevent screen/computer sleep during flash
- [x] Flash execution is client-side (runs in browser) — continues without internet once page is loaded
- [x] Track last successful block index via currentBlock in SimulatorState (resume capability is partial — state not persisted to storage yet)

## Feature — Real PCAN Bridge Flash (not simulation)
- [x] Built pcanFlashEngine.ts — real CAN bus flash execution via PCANConnection WebSocket bridge
- [x] Sends actual UDS commands (TesterPresent 0x3E, DiagnosticSessionControl 0x10, SecurityAccess 0x27, RequestDownload 0x34, TransferData 0x36, TransferExit 0x37, ECUReset 0x11, ClearDTC 0x14, CommunicationControl 0x28, ControlDTCSetting 0x85)
- [x] Handles real ECU responses with NRC description table (common codes: 0x10-0x78 mapped, with fallback for unmapped codes)
- [x] Implements real seed/key exchange — GM_5B_AES (Web Crypto API) and Ford_3B_LFSR algorithms, with fallback to container header pre-computed key
- [x] Transfers actual file data blocks from container ArrayBuffer with proper chunking by xferSize and block sequence counter
- [x] Real-time progress tracking based on actual bytes transferred
- [x] FlashMissionControl wired to use PCANFlashEngine when connectionMode='pcan', simulator when 'simulator' (code path implemented, requires live PCAN bridge for end-to-end testing)
- [x] LIVE badge and safety warnings displayed during real flash
- [x] Emergency abort button for real flash (calls engine.abort())
- [x] Pause button hidden during real flash (cannot pause real CAN bus communication)
- [x] Key cycle user prompts with countdown timer during KEY_CYCLE phase (UI scaffolded, triggers when engine reaches KEY_CYCLE commands)
- [x] PCANConnection instance created when bridge is detected, passed to MissionControl (connection established on flash start via engine)
- [x] Container ArrayBuffer and header passed to MissionControl for real flash data access

## Bug Fix — Real Flash: ECU Not Responding to TesterPresent
- [x] Root cause: Flash engine was calling sendUDSRequest without first calling conn.connect() — WebSocket was not open, so all requests returned null ("WebSocket not connected") which was misreported as "No response from ECU"
- [x] Flash engine now calls conn.connect() at start of execute() and switches to extended diagnostic session before flash commands
- [x] Differentiates bridge disconnection vs ECU no-response — checks conn.getState() and attempts auto-reconnect if bridge drops
- [x] Increased request timeout from 3s to 30s for flash operations (erase can take 10-30s)
- [x] CAN addresses already correct for E41 (0x7E0/0x7E8) — extracted from flash plan commands
