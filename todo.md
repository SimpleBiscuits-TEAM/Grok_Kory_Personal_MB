# V-OP Project TODO

## Migration from VOP-Main-Brain to Hosted Project
- [x] Copy all client source code (272 files: components, pages, lib, hooks, contexts)
- [x] Copy server files (routers.ts, db.ts, storage.ts, index.ts, 39 router modules)
- [x] Copy server/lib directory (knoxShieldMiddleware, knoxKnowledgeServer, etc.)
- [x] Copy server/_core overrides (index.ts with helmet/rate-limit, oauth.ts with retry logic, trpc.ts with super_admin)
- [x] Copy drizzle schema files (schema.ts + 6 sub-schemas)
- [x] Copy shared directory (const.ts, types.ts, knoxKnowledge.ts)
- [x] Copy config files (tsconfig.json, vite.config.ts, vitest.config.ts, drizzle.config.ts, components.json)
- [x] Copy docs and firmware directories
- [x] Install 16 missing dependencies (three.js, chart.js, helmet, jspdf, etc.)
- [x] Sync package.json scripts and pnpm overrides
- [x] Migrate database schema (96 tables, 37 ALTER statements, 83 indexes)
- [x] Fix too-long FK identifier (calibration_values constraint)
- [x] Mark migration as applied in __drizzle_migrations
- [x] Verify TypeScript compiles with 0 errors
- [x] Verify dev server starts and serves HTTP 200
- [x] Verify version badge displays v0.06
- [x] Verify all UI components render (PpeiHeader, What's New, Analyze tab, etc.)

## Existing Features (Preserved)
- [x] Datalog analysis (WP8/CSV parser, diagnostic engine)
- [x] Calibration Editor (binary parser, map editor, 3D surface view)
- [x] IntelliSpy (Knox AI diagnostic agent)
- [x] Drag Racing module
- [x] Fleet Management
- [x] Community forums
- [x] PDF export (health reports, dyno sheets)
- [x] AuthGate with access codes, share tokens, NDA signing
- [x] Admin panel (user management, notifications, audit log)
- [x] Support system (sessions, recordings, metrics)
- [x] Tune library and sharing
- [x] Protocol support (J1939, K-Line, OBD-II)
- [x] Live casting (DynoCast)

## Access Code Setup
- [x] Seed KINGKONG as the required access code when site launches
- [x] Verify AuthGate prompts for access code on first visit
- [x] Verify entering KINGKONG grants access to the site

## Auth Simplification
- [x] Remove OAuth login button/option from AuthGate — access code only entry
- [x] ~~Remove access code/login requirement on the Advanced tab~~ (reverted — user wants gate to stay)
- [x] Update tests to reflect the changes

## Auth Correction
- [x] Restore AccessGate on Advanced tab — KINGKONG code required for both site entry AND Advanced

## Tasks Panel Restoration
- [x] Find the Tasks button/panel in Advanced section that was hidden by admin-only check
- [x] Restore Tasks so it's visible to all users after entering access code in Advanced

## Tasks Panel Admin Check Bug
- [x] Remove admin-only check inside TasksPanel component (shows "admin required" when non-admin clicks TASKS)

## Mandatory Access Code for ALL Users
- [x] Fix AuthGate: access code must be required even if user is signed in via OAuth
- [x] Fix server checkAccess: do not return authenticated=true based on OAuth alone — always require vop_access cookie
- [x] Verify: OAuth-signed-in users still see the access code gate before entering the site

## Advanced Tab Access Code Gate Bug
- [x] Fix Advanced tab AccessGate — not requiring access code entry, letting users straight through
