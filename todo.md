- [x] Migrate database schema (96 tables, 37 ALTER statements, 83 indexes)
- [x] Fix too-long FK identifier (calibration_values constraint)
- [x] Mark migration as applied in __drizzle_migrations
- [x] Verify TypeScript compiles with 0 errors
- [x] Verify dev server starts and serves HTTP 200
- [x] Verify version badge displays v0.06
- [x] Verify all UI components render (PpeiHeader, What's New, Analyze tab, etc.)

## Existing Features (Preserved)
- [x] Datalog analysis (WP8/CSV parser, diagnostic engine)
- [x] Calibration Editor (binary parser, map editor, 3D surface view)
- [x] IntelliSpy (Knox AI diagnostic agent)
- [x] Drag Racing module
- [x] Fleet Management
- [x] Community forums
- [x] PDF export (health reports, dyno sheets)
- [x] AuthGate with access codes, share tokens, NDA signing
- [x] Admin panel (user management, notifications, audit log)
- [x] Support system (sessions, recordings, metrics)
- [x] Tune library and sharing
- [x] Protocol support (J1939, K-Line, OBD-II)
- [x] Live casting (DynoCast)

## Access Code Setup
- [x] Seed KINGKONG as the required access code when site launches
- [x] Verify AuthGate prompts for access code on first visit
- [x] Verify entering KINGKONG grants access to the site

## Auth Simplification
- [x] Remove OAuth login button/option from AuthGate — access code only entry
- [x] ~~Remove access code/login requirement on the Advanced tab~~ (reverted — user wants gate to stay)
- [x] Update tests to reflect the changes

## Auth Correction
- [x] Restore AccessGate on Advanced tab — KINGKONG code required for both site entry AND Advanced

## Tasks Panel Restoration
- [x] Find the Tasks button/panel in Advanced section that was hidden by admin-only check
- [x] Restore Tasks so it's visible to all users after entering access code in Advanced

## Tasks Panel Admin Check Bug
- [x] Remove admin-only check inside TasksPanel component (shows "admin required" when non-admin clicks TASKS)

## Mandatory Access Code for ALL Users
- [x] Fix AuthGate: access code must be required even if user is signed in via OAuth
- [x] Fix server checkAccess: do not return authenticated=true based on OAuth alone — always require vop_access cookie
- [x] Verify: OAuth-signed-in users still see the access code gate before entering the site

## Advanced Tab Access Code Gate Bug
- [x] Fix Advanced tab AccessGate — not requiring access code entry, letting users straight through

## Tasks Tab Access Code Gate
- [x] Add separate access code gate to the Tasks tab — must enter KINGKONG again after entering Advanced

## Flash System — Full Build (Orchestrator, Sessions, UI)
- [x] Create shared/pcanFlashOrchestrator.ts (flash plan generation, simulator engine, recovery plans, NRC descriptions, fun facts)
- [x] Create shared/flashFileValidator.ts (CRC32 big-endian, format detection, file validation, pre-flight checklist, battery voltage evaluation)
- [x] Create DB schema for flash sessions, session logs, ECU snapshots, flash queue, flash stats, file fingerprints, rollback files
- [x] Run drizzle migration for flash tables
- [x] Create server/flashDb.ts with all database helpers (CRUD for sessions, logs, snapshots, queue, stats, comparison, export)
- [x] Expand server/routers/flash.ts with 20+ endpoints (createSession, updateSession, appendLogs, getSessionLogs, exportSession, saveSnapshot, getSnapshots, compareSnapshots, addToQueue, getQueue, updateQueueItem, stats, allStats, compareSessions, checkDuplicate, preFlightChecklist, notifyFlashComplete, completeSession)
- [x] Create PreFlightChecklist component (server-side validation, ECU recognition, security profile, hardware check, duplicate detection)
- [x] Create FlashMissionControl component (full simulation UI with progress bars, phase indicators, log viewer, recovery plans, fun facts, server session recording)
- [x] Update FlashContainerPanel with PCAN Flash section, Simulator section, Dashboard section, PreFlight gate, session creation, file hash computation
- [x] Create FlashDashboard component (session history table, overall stats, queue management, session comparison)
- [x] Write 54 vitest tests for flash orchestrator, file validator, session management, queue/stats, pre-flight checklist, snapshots, notifications
- [x] Verify CRC32 uses big-endian at offset 0x1000 (confirmed correct in flashFileValidator.ts)
- [x] All 69 flash tests pass (15 original + 54 new)

## Analyzer UX Improvements
- [x] Move Compare feature from public Analyzer to Advanced mode Analyzer only
- [x] Add "Quick Rundown" toggle to HealthReport for simplified breakdown
- [x] Add "Quick Rundown" toggle to DiagnosticReport for simplified breakdown
- [x] Add fun upgrade prompt in public Analyzer ("YOU'RE RUNNING ON STOCK BOOST") to nudge users toward V-OP Pro

## Bug Fix — PCAN Flash Detection
- [x] Fix PCAN detection in flash system — use same PCANConnection.isBridgeAvailable() as datalogger/bridge

## Bug Fix — PCAN Flash Error After Plan Generation
- [x] Fix error in PCAN flash section after flash plan shows "1 blocks, 1.4 MB" — investigate launch flow and MissionControl integration

## Bug Fix — Flash Plan Validation Errors Block Launch
- [x] Fix generateFlashPlan producing validationErrors for valid containers (shows "1 blocks, 1.4 MB" with red X, disables Launch button)
- [x] Changed seed/key check from blocking error to warning (seed/key embedded in container, extracted at flash time)
- [x] Changed unknown ECU check from blocking error to warning (can still flash with default CAN addresses)
- [x] Added warnings[] field to FlashPlan interface for non-blocking issues
- [x] Updated FlashContainerPanel PCAN section with 3-state status (ok/warn/fail) instead of binary ok/fail
- [x] Updated FlashMissionControl ValidationPanel to display warnings in amber
- [x] Added 3 new tests + enhanced 1 existing test for warning behavior (57 flash tests total)

## Bug Fix — file_fingerprints Table Schema Mismatch
- [x] Fix "Failed query" error on file_fingerprints table — table existed with old schema (column `hash` instead of `fileHash`, etc.)
- [x] Dropped and recreated all 6 flash tables (flash_sessions, flash_session_logs, ecu_snapshots, flash_queue, flash_stats, file_fingerprints) with correct Drizzle schema — all were empty (0 rows)
- [x] Verified all 57 flash integration tests pass after table recreation

## Bug Fix — Flash Simulator Too Fast + Completion Screen Disappears
- [x] Flash simulator completes unrealistically fast — reduced transfer rate from 4000 bytes/tick to 4 bytes/ms (~4 KB/s realistic CAN bus UDS speed)
- [x] Completion screen disappears without showing log report — removed auto-dismiss setTimeout, added DONE + DOWNLOAD LOG buttons, auto-expand log on completion
- [x] Seed/key exchange appeared to work but download phase was instant — added realistic per-phase delays (1.5s-8s per command type)
- [x] Added CAN TX/RX log entries during block transfers for realism (every ~5% of block)
- [x] Fix E41 ECU name — now displays as "E41 (L5P Duramax)" instead of "Bosch MG1CS111 (L5P Duramax)"
- [x] Verify ECU names against strategy docs / A2L references — all GM-Delco ECUs use PPEI strategy names (E41, E88, E90, etc.), Bosch/Ford/Cummins use part numbers
- [x] Updated estimated time calculation to match realistic timing
- [x] Log area expands to h-72 on completion and shows ALL entries (not just last 100)
